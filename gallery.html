        <!-- </div> -->
        <p>
          My first 'true' cosplay (as opposed to a Halloween costume) was Captain Mal Reynolds from the sci-fi TV series 'Firefly'. I found a brown duster coat online (that ended up being quite large on me) and a toy revolver, and with the help of a family friend, sewed stripes onto a pair of pants. It was quite simple and not particularly accurate, but I had a lot of fun wearing it and was hooked on the hobby.

      <!-- </div> -->
        <p>
          The next year, I put together what I felt at the time to be my first 'good' cosplay, Vash the Stampede from the Japanese series 'Trigun'. It was again mostly made from things I'd bought, but I felt so cool walking around the con wearing the long red leather duster (having a rather questionable fashion sense at the time, I ended up wearing that duster quite frequently during my sophomore and junior years).

        <!-- </div> -->
        <p>
          The first cosplay that I made anything substantial for was Booker Dewitt from the game 'Bioshock Infinite' that fall, with a vest, holster rig, and tie that I'd made myself and a pistol I'd painted. I also did my first attempt at weathering all the main pieces of clothing with paint, and I tried using some dirt makeup on my face and arms. I consider Booker to be my best early cosplay.

        <img src="images/connor_2.JPG" alt="Connor Kenway, one of my many 'Assassin's Creed' cosplays">
        <p>
          Over the course of that year, I became heavily invested in the 'Assassin's Creed' video game series, and began wanting to cosplay many of its protagonists (I will only be showing my favorites here). My first attempt at making the coat for Connor Kenway from 'Assassin's Creed III' (detailed in the Sewing section) did not result in a usable garment, but the following spring I made a second version from an all-new pattern (although I did reuse the removable hood).

        <p>
          The next year, I cosplayed Shay Cormac from 'Assassin's Creed Rogue', which to this day is still the most complex outfit I have made. The coat alone (made primarily of very thick upholstery velvet) had many different little parts and took months to complete. I loved how it turned out, but it was so uncomfortable and cumbersome I have not tried wearing it again since.

        <p>
          My favorite Assassin's Creed cosplay was Jacob Frye, from 'Assassin's Creed Syndicate. I put my first version together over the summer leading up to its October release, and in my rush I ended up settling for some less-than-deal materials. The following year, I remade his coat with much more accurate and higher quality fabric and leather and a brand new, better-fitting pattern (a variation of which has been used for every coat and jacket I have made since), as well as more accurate pants, shirt, and accessories.

        <p>
        As for other highlights of my time as a cosplayer: 'Mad Max' is another one of my most complex costumes. The leather jacket I bought ended up being too big, so I sold it after wearing it a few times, but one day I want to remake the outfit. My Mad Max photoshoot is one of the ones I am most proud of, when I braved the mid-July heat clad head-to-toe in black leather to take pictures at an abandoned gas station (about the closest I could get locally to a location on the Fury Road).

        <p>
          After the release of 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' a year later, I felt a strong urge to cosplay the hero, Newt Scamander (who I strongly identified with thanks to his social awkwardness). I was able to put his entire outfit together in about a month and a half before a winter con I was attending. Over this past break, I remade his vest, and I am currently remaking his coat with better fabric and an updated pattern. My new version will also see the pants, shirt, and some accessories get upgraded.

        <img src="images/mustang.JPG" alt="My cosplay of Roy Mustang from 'Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood', another one of my most ambitious sewing projects">
        <p>
          After I finished Newt, I got working on Colonel Roy Mustang, from one of my favorite Japanese shows, 'Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood'. While not the most complicated outfit I have made in terms of overall number of pieces, a three-piece military uniform with an overcoat was still quite daunting, and I worked on it off-and-on for about 6 months before finishing it. I wanted it to look as much like a real-life military uniform as possible, so I toned down the colors (opting for a more subdued navy rather than a bright royal blue like in the source material) and whenever possible, used actual military items for parts like his ribbon rack and rank insignias. I am very proud of how the uniform turned out, but eventually I want to remake the coat, update a few accessories, and add an accurate wig.

          While I was working on Mustang, a video game developer I follow ran a contest during the week leading up to anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic for Titanic-themed cosplays and costumes. I decided to throw together a cosplay of Jack Dawson (using clothes I already owned), and I ended up winning an honorable mention, making it my first (and so far only) cosplay contest entry.
