        <p>
          While I've concentrated more on sewing than propmaking as a cosplayer, I have enjoyed developing my skills working on props over the years. Some of the first props I made were pistols for Malcolm Reynolds from 'Firefly' and Vash the Stampede from the Japanese animated show 'Trigun'. They were made by cutting parts off of existing toy guns (keeping the handles and triggers), and creating new barrels with posterboard and hot glue.

        <img src="images/attackontitan.JPG" alt="The complex gear I made for 'Attack on Titan', involving swords, sheathes, and more">
        <p>
          Later that summer (before my sophomore year of college), I took on what is still probably my most ambitious prop project yet: an extensive set of swords, sheaths, gas cannisters, and other machinery connected by belts and hoses from another Japanese show, 'Attack on Titan'. It was constructed almost entirely from cardboard, hot glue, and silver metallic duct tape, with wooden dowels and cut clothes hangers for strength and old audio cables for the hoses. It was extremely difficult to wear (and transport!), but I was very proud of it nonetheless.

        <p>
          The next year I advanced my propmaking skills by making a Steampunk version of Han Solo's blaster from 'Star Wars'. I bought an airsoft Mauser C96 (the same pistol his actual blaster prop was made from), and glued various parts onto it, include a scope I'd made from pieces of PVC pipe. It wasn't perfect, but it was definitely my most professional-looking prop at the time.

      <div class="image-and-text">
        <img src="images/bladerunner_blaster_1.JPG" alt="My first Blade Runner blaster, which required extensive modifications to the base prop">
        <p>
          Next, I wanted to make Rick Deckard's blaster from 'Blade Runner'. I had found a toy on Amazon that was very close, but it had a couple major inaccuracies that complicated things a bit. I ended up completely taking it apart and removing the electronics inside. I added some old microphone parts my dad didn't need to simulate an inner barrel under the slider, and I cut up a small hand sanitizer bottle to cover a large hole in the middle above the trigger assembly. The trickiest part of this build was how to simulate the transluscent amber-colored grips on the original. I settled on painting the handle silver and then going over the grip sections with two different shades of orange Sharpie. From a distance I thought it looked pretty good.

      <div class="image-and-text">
        <img src="images/solo_blaster.JPG" alt="My more accurate Solo blaster">
        <p>
          This past year I made a more film-accurate version of Han's blaster (although it was simply a toy I painted, with no cutting or gluing involved).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-and-text">
        <img src="images/bladerunner_blaster_2.JPG" alt="My second Blade Runner blaster, currently probably my favorite prop I have made">
        <p>
          I also made what is probably my favorite prop of all, an updated version of the Blade Runner blaster. I was able to buy a water pistol that had been released based on the blaster, featuring a much more accurate sculpt than the toy my first version was based on and, most importantly, transluscent orange grips. Aside from having to carefully remove the grips without breaking them to make sure I did not get paint on them, this was quite a simple job of painting (and gluing an orange tip to the barrel for safety), but I am very proud of how it turned out.
